# Danny Ma SQL Challenge
### By Okonkwo Chukwuebuka Malcom

The 8 Week SQL Challenge is inspired by the [Data With Danny](https://bit.ly/datawithdanny-8wsc) virtual data apprenticeship program to celebrate the launch of his Serious SQL course! The SQL Challenge could be found [Here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/getting-started/)

For the next 8 weeks - **I challenge myself to**:

- Dedicate myself to learning SQL and practicing problem solving with SQL
- Complete the 8 weeks Challenge using SQL 
- Write a Medium Post about the challenge and sharing my analysis
